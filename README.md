# Exploration-Prototype-02
Exploration prototype for week 07
------------------------------------------------
Prototype 02 Design Journal.

**Design hypothesis**\
One game aspect that is, in my opinion, interesting to explore is player freedom in all his facets. With this prototype, I intend to ask myself the question; to what extent the developer needs to provide a clear pathway toward an objective.

To answer this question I plan to create a 2D platformer, where the player creates himself his own route toward an objective.

In this prototype, the player will be restricted to a vertical rectangle, in which he will need to obtain stars, while creating a path toward the top of the rectangle. To do so, it will be possible for him to create small jump pads that propel him jump vertically.

I hope that this game will be challenging, and have some replay value.

**Prototype 01 Reflection**\
I was not there for prototype 01, thus I have no feedback for reflection.
